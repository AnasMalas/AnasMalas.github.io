<details> <summary>A blog created to share my PCB and electronics knowledge, and to force me to research deeper. Click here to learn more.</summary>

Welcome to my blog!

On Aug 2022, I started posting PCB and electronics related content on LinkedIn. At the time, this had two reasons: Boost my chances of employment after graduating from university, and to share some of the knowledge I gained through self study and personal projects during university.

I quickly found out that LinkedIn's 3000 character limit forced me to write and re-write the content until I felt that it was concise and precise enough. They say that you dont understand something unless you can explain it to a 5 year old, and I felt that I dont fully grasp a subject whenever the character limit didnt suffice. Most of my posts took 5+ hours to write, most of which is to understand the topic better.

While I probably wont be able to post often, I would like to continue doing so. My posts will aim to fit fully within the 3000 character limit (excluding appendix), and I will not use AI tools to help me write the posts as that reduces my learning value (maybe I'll use them to help me organize my thoughts or find references, but all writing is my own).

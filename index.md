Welcome to my blog!
<br/><br/>  
I'm an electronics engineer who is obsessed with making things that work on the very first try. I spent four years on my very first project (back when I did not know anything about PCB design) just to understand not only how to design, but why should it be done this or that way. The internet is full of contradicting opinions, even large companies such as Texas Instruments and Analog Devices can disagree with each other in datasheets and application notes while both being right... or both wrong. My duty is to understand why something is done and where it may be applicable. I hope to share some of what I learn here.
 <br/><br/>  
 On Aug 2022, I started posting PCB and electronics related content on LinkedIn. At the time, this had two reasons: Boost my chances of employment after graduating from university, and to share some of the knowledge I gained through self study and personal projects during university.
<br/><br/>  
I quickly found out that LinkedIn's 3000 character limit forced me to write and re-write the content until I felt that it was concise and precise enough. They say that you dont understand something unless you can explain it to a 5 year old, and I felt that I dont fully grasp a subject whenever the character limit didnt suffice. Most of my posts took 5+ hours to write, most of which is to understand the topic better.
<br/><br/>  
While I probably wont be able to post often, I would like to continue doing so. My posts will aim to fit fully within the 3000 character limit (excluding appendix), and I will not use AI tools to help me write the posts as that reduces my learning value (maybe I'll use them to help me organize my thoughts or find references, but all writing is my own).
